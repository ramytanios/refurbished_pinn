# Physics Informed Neural Networks In Computational Finance: High Dimensional Forward & Inverse Option Pricing

_Abstract_: *Physics Informed Neural Networks have been recently widely used to successfully approx- imate solutions to partial differential equations. They also proved to be performant for estimating solutions and unknown model parameters from observed measurements. We therefore present the applications of such techniques for pricing multi-assets options un- der the high dimensional Black-Scholes and Heston models. We then present a simple and straight-forward way for computing the Greeks that in turn play an important role in computational finance. Finally, we consider inferring the volatility function and pricing options from a set of observed prices. Numerical simulations as well as generalization errors are also presented.*
